# Requirement
# Functional Requirements
predict disease with given symptoms
Compare given symptoms with input dataset

# Non-Functional Requirements
Display list of symptoms where user can select the symptoms
more than 2 Algorithms were used to predict disease

# Cost 
Cost
Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!

# 4W's and 1'H
Who: 
This is a helping hand for those who wants to knw the disease the are suffering from according to the symptoms. Even time and cost can be saved

What: 
A disease predictor to predict the disease acoording to the symptoms

When: 
when people wants early prediction of disease and even if there is no doctor available near them

Where: 
Can be used when doctoris not present or out of your reach.

How: 
user need to enter the symptoms at max 5 symptoms can be entered. There is drop down box which has a list of all the symptoms where user can choose. Once user select the symptoms on clicking prediction button, the disease will be predicted by different algorithms.
